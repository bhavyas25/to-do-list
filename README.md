## Description

This application allows users to create a to-do list. Users can add items to the list and delete items when they are completed.

The application is built with React and consists of three components:

- `App.js`: The main component that renders the overall structure of the application.
- `TodoItem.js`: A component that renders the form section of the application for adding new to-do items.
- `TodoList.js`: A component that renders the list section of the application, displaying the added to-do items and providing delete functionality.

The state management is handled using the `useState` hook from React.
